# TMAControl-Client
Simple minimal Python3 client for High Can Fly TMA Controller.

# About us
* Me ( Ronan ) I'm a self-employed developper and a paraglider pilot
* We ( [High Can Fly parapente](https://www.highcanfly.club) ) are a french paragliding club who start the development and the exploitation of a VHF reporter for the TMA Lille 3.1 .

# Server
Server code is available on Github here (https://github.com/eltorio/TMAControl)  # Limitations
This is a pre-alpha version sort of a technology demonstrator for Ligue de Vol Libre Nord-Pas de Calais-Picardie and DGAC Subdivision de Lille.

# Architecture
Based on client architecture the  system consist basically on a server storing the TMA State and a client broadcasting the TMA State in voice mode over a FM VHF frequency.

## Server
Server module is developped with well known and secured Laravel framework.
Anyone who reach the server can view the public views.
* /tmastatesecuredmessage gives a minimal JSON secured message
* /tmastateview gives a HTML5 response

Associated with that, authenticated users have access  to other routes depending on their roles:
* /tmastatechange (needs the setter role)
* /tmastatechange/list (needs the viewer role)

Changing the state of the TMA is simly adding a line on a table with the current state (active/inactive/system on maintenance).
Viewing list this table on the database.
The different states are uniquely identified with a uuid v4 identifier
```php
     $ids = [
       App\Models\StateMessage {
         id: "1",
         uuid: "a4d651bb-bc98-4e57-ae95-dfa94a415b19",
         message: "TMA active",
       },
       App\Models\StateMessage {
         id: "2",
         uuid: "42917626-92c7-4f16-a5e0-6fab087f42b5",
         message: "TMA inactive",
       },
       App\Models\StateMessage {
         id: "3",
         uuid: "1bebbccc-e29e-4a8c-8834-3cfeae21432d",
         message: "System on maintenance",
       },
     ]
```
For securing the message and giving to the client the ability to check that the message is coming from the authority the message is signed with the private key (RSA) of a X509 certificate. The signature is computed with the standard sha256 signature algorithm.

The secured message is something like:
```json
{"message":"{\"uuid\":\"1bebbccc-e29e-4a8c-8834-3cfeae21432d\",\"timestamp\":\"2021-02-17T17:44:16.000000Z\"}","signature":"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"}
```
it can be decoded as two javascript variables first is an array:
```javascript
let messsage = {"uuid":"1bebbccc-e29e-4a8c-8834-3cfeae21432d","timestamp":"2021-02-17T17:44:16.000000Z"}
```
second is simply a long string. This is an hexstring reprentation of the binary signature of the message variable.

Given the certificate corresponding to the signing private key a very basic check on Python3 can be done like:
```python
import binascii
from OpenSSL import crypto

certificate = 'pemcertificatestring'
signature = bytes.fromhex(longhexsignature)
server_cert = crypto.load_certificate(crypto.FILETYPE_PEM, certificate)
pubkey = server_cert.get_pubkey()
crypto.verify(server_cert, signature, data, 'sha256')
```
if the signature is wrong it throws an exception otherwise nothingâ€¦ Well done message is authenticated.

### Funny check
On the server on the tmastateview users can scan a QR code representing a URL with https://SERVER_FQDN/checkmessage?message=XXXX&signature=YYYYYY
The server checks the signature and answer OK or NOK with its internal cerificate

## Python3 tiny Client
Multiple client can communicate with the server. Basically it reads http(s)://SERVER_FQDN/tmastatesecuredmessage .
The python3 tiny client is designed to be light for be embeded on a Raspberry Pi3.

Because our TLS certificate is a real certificate we consider sufficient to rely on Python ssl security.
We trust Mozilla root certificates list so we use it:
```bash
pip3 install certifi
```
With that the connection to our SERVER_FQDN is certified and trusted. So the process is:
* client connects to our server
* client saves server certificate by storing the certificate sent in https with SNI
* client requests the message and decodes it
* client checks the message with the provided signature and the already retrieved X509 certificate
* finally if the message is authenticated the corresponding mp3 file is played over the air.

## Client installation
```bash
pip3 install pyOpenSSL
pip3 install playsound
pip3 install gpiozero
```

## Running
```bash
#on crontab each 5 minutes
/usr/bin/python3 $CLIPATH/client.py
```
